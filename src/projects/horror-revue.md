As a horror fan, I love to read horror novels, watch horror-themed TV shows, and watch horror movies. I decided to create a website to review the movies and TV shows I'd watched and books I'd read. To make building my blog a bit more challenging, I decided to forego WordPress and use 11ty and NetlifyCMS to build the blog. 

### Technologies Used
For this project I used HTML5, CSS3, some JavaScript, 11ty static site generator, and NetlifyCMS. I chose to use GitHub to store the repository and Netlify hosting to present it to the world. 

### Challenges and Lessons Learned
This was the first site I'd built using 11ty that I actually had added styles to and it was a challenge to get everything to appear as I wanted it to. However, after reading many tutorials and just generally playing around with the site, it started to come together.

The biggest lesson learned from creating this site was not to give up. If I couldn't get something to work the way I wanted it to, I'd put the site away and come back to it later.

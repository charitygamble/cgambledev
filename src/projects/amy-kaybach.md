The website for amy kaybach was requested by amy to be created using WordPress. She had a specific theme in mind to be used on the blog, so the mainthing I did was set up the blog, install necessary themes and plugins, and customize the theme to amy's specifications.

### Technologies Used
The technology used for this particular website was self-hosted WordPress, along with the WooCommerce plugin to create her web store.

### Challenges and Lessons Learned
The main challenge with creating this website was ensuring that WooCommerce was running properly so when she opened the site, people would be able to purchase her books without any troubles. Things went beautifully and amy has been very happy with her site.

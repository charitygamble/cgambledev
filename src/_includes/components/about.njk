               I started building websites in 1999, when I taught myself HTML4.0. I soon graduated to XHTML and CSS, which turned to HTML5 and CSS. In 2003, I started working with WordPress by building HTML/CSS layouts and designs and then using WordPress to power the blog, including it into the HTML files using php includes. As time went on, I started using WordPress by itself, creating themes for blogs and websites. Today I customized pre-existing themes and I am working on full-site editing and creation using the block editor.

            <p>My preferred technologies are HTML, CSSm and 11ty. I am currently learning Tailwind CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, and am planning to try to advance my JavaScript skills as well as learn React.js.</p>
